# Neural 1 Core

> "The First to Think."

This repository contains the foundational architecture for **Neural 1 (N1)** — an artificial general intelligence system designed to reason, learn, and self-improve across domains.

### 🌐 Overview
Neural 1 Core is not just a chatbot. It is an evolving cognitive engine with:

- Modular reasoning and planning
- Memory architecture (short + long-term)
- Reflection and self-correction
- Tool use capabilities
- Multi-agent integration

### 🧩 Architecture (Coming Soon)
- `n1_engine.py` – Main reasoning loop
- `planner/` – Goal management and decision logic
- `memory/` – Vector & symbolic memory systems
- `tools/` – External tool interface (e.g., code interpreter, web search)
- `core/` – Prompting + inner voice

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+
- PyTorch
- LangChain
- FAISS or ChromaDB
- Open-source LLM (LLaMA3 / Mixtral / Gemma)
