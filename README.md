# Neural 1 Core

Neural 1 Core is the foundational reasoning engine powering all cognitive systems within the Neural 1 architecture. It serves as the central loop for planning, decision-making, memory integration, and self-directed learning.

## Architecture Overview

The system is designed as a modular, extensible cognitive framework capable of:

- Generalized task execution across domains
- Integration with memory and tool systems
- Dynamic prompting and multi-agent planning
- Introspective feedback and self-correction

## Core Modules (Planned)

| Module               | Function                                             |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `n1_engine.py`       | Main reasoning and orchestration loop                |
| `planner/`           | Goal decomposition, prioritization, and task routing |
| `core/`              | Prompt construction, response formatting, system control |
| `tools/`             | Interfaces to external utilities (e.g., REPL, web search) |
| `hooks/`             | Self-reflection, output evaluation, and meta-learning |
| `interfaces/`        | Communication bridge to agents and memory            |
